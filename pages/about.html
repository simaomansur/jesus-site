          <h2>Who we are</h2>

          <p class="subhead">
            Rocky Mountain Hyperbaric Institute provides oxygen-based therapy for a wide variety of
            medical conditions, with care guided by medical oversight and patient safety.
          </p>

          <div class="about-copy">
            <p>
              Hyperbaric oxygen therapy involves breathing medical-grade oxygen in a pressurized
              chamber. Under pressure, oxygen can dissolve more readily into the bloodstream, which
              may support oxygen delivery to tissues where circulation is reduced.
            </p>

            <p>
              Hyperbaric therapy has been studied for decades and is used for specific medical
              indications. The FDA has cleared hyperbaric chambers for certain conditions, including
              carbon monoxide poisoning, selected infections, radiation-related tissue injury, and
              some non-healing wounds. Whether HBOT is appropriate depends on your diagnosis and
              overall medical context.
            </p>

            <p>
              HBOT is non-invasive, and sessions are often quiet and comfortable. Many patients
              choose to relax, listen to music, or watch a movie during treatment. As with any
              medical therapy, HBOT carries potential risks and is not right for everyone. We’ll
              explain what to expect and answer questions before you begin.
