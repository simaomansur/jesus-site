          <h2>What is hyperbaric oxygen therapy?</h2>
          <p class="subhead">
            Hyperbaric oxygen therapy, often called HBOT, is a medical treatment that helps increase the amount
            of oxygen available to the body.
          </p>

          <p class="hbot-body">
            During a session, individuals breathe medical-grade oxygen inside a specially designed chamber where
            air pressure is safely increased under medical supervision. This combination of oxygen and pressure
            allows oxygen to be delivered more efficiently throughout the body than it can be under normal conditions.

            <h2>Why oxygen matters</h2>
            <p class="subhead">
              Oxygen plays an essential role in nearly every function involved in healing and recovery.
            </p>

            <p class="hbot-body">
              It supports tissue repair, helps the body manage inflammation, and plays a role in the body’s ability
              to resist infection. In some situations, injury, illness, or compromised circulation can limit how much
              oxygen reaches certain tissues. When oxygen delivery is reduced, healing processes may slow, and the body
              may have a harder time repairing itself.

          <h2>How pressure changes oxygen delivery</h2>
          <p class="subhead">
            Pressure is what makes HBOT different from breathing oxygen at normal atmospheric pressure.
          </p>

          <p class="hbot-body">
            Under increased pressure, oxygen is able to dissolve more readily into the body’s fluids, including plasma.
            This allows oxygen to reach areas that may not be receiving enough oxygen through normal circulation alone.
          </p>

          <p class="hbot-body">
            By improving oxygen availability at the tissue level, hyperbaric therapy helps create an environment where
            the body’s natural repair processes can function more effectively.

            <p class="subhead">
              Most sessions feel quiet and comfortable, with continuous monitoring by trained staff.
            </p>

            <p class="hbot-body">
              Each session takes place in a clear, medical-grade chamber designed for comfort and safety. Patients
              typically lie down and rest while breathing oxygen as the chamber gradually reaches the prescribed pressure.
            </p>

            <p class="hbot-body">
              Some individuals notice mild ear pressure during this phase, similar to what is experienced during changes
              in altitude. This sensation is usually brief and can often be relieved by swallowing or gently clearing the ears.
            </p>

            <p class="hbot-body">
              Once treatment pressure is reached, many patients relax, listen to music, or watch a movie. Pressure is
              gradually returned to normal at the end of treatment, and most people are able to resume normal daily activities.
